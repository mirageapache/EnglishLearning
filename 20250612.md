## 文章標題：The Korean bakery chain that says croissants don't have to be French

**連結**：https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c629q4v05pwo

### 原文
Head into the basement of any bustling mall in Singapore and the chances are you will smell the sweetness of fresh, buttery baked goods.

Long lines of people swarm the counters of Korean, Japanese, Taiwanese and Singaporean bakeries – tray and tongs in hand, after picking out cream rolls and milk breads or filled croissants and fruity pastries from crowded display cabinets.

For Paris Baguette, its inspiration is clearly in the name, the outlets are also decorated with the colours of the tricolour, the signage shows the Eiffel Tower and the ambience seems to be aiming for something close to the charm of a Parisian cafe.

But it is 100% Korean.

"I wouldn't limit our bread to everything from France. We are an international brand," says Jin-soo Hur, president and chief executive of SPC Group, which owns Paris Baguette.

"Like croissants, could you say this is a European product? I would say it's a universal product."

SPC traces its roots back to a small family-owned bakery shop that opened 80 years ago.

It is now a key player in mass producing bread and pastries in South Korea, employing 20,000 people across all its brands. SPC says its sales hit $5.6bn (£4.26bn) last year.

In 1988, Paris Baguette was born becoming the first Korean bakery brand to open an international store in China, which continues to be a big market.

Today it has 4,000 stores across 14 countries including in Asia, Europe and the US.

Paris Baguette has big overseas expansion plans, setting a target of more than 1,000 new branches internationally by 2030 – many of them in the US.

It's investing in a factory in Texas which will become its largest overseas production facility when it is completed in 2027, supplying the US, Canada and Latin America.

For Mr Hur, capturing the American market is a priority because it would mean Paris Baguette has succeeded internationally.

- Food as culture
Sport is central to Paris Baguette's strategy through a partnership with English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur.

It had a similar deal with France's Paris St Germain for two seasons, providing fans with its baked products and desserts on match days of home games.

"I think food is culture. Sports brings a lot of people into the stadium, and there's always good vibes in London," said Mr Hur.

The captain of South Korea's national team was also the captain of Spurs. Son Heung-min led his team to victory in the Europa League last month, ending the club's 17-year wait for a trophy.

It's not about a Korean leading Spurs for Mr Hur though.

Tottenham is a "top club and Paris Baguette wants to be best in class too," he says.


- K-mania
Workers don't like to wake up early to knead dough by hand, Mr Hur says softly.

He credits his company's system of delivering frozen dough to franchises around the world for improving efficiency and extending shelf life.

Asia has a strong heritage of baked goods, but with rapid urbanisation, and changing lifestyles demand for on-the-go convenience foods is growing steadily.

Bakeries across the region already offer a huge variety of items.

Staples like pain au chocolat and sandwiches are abundant, but they are also known for Asian-inspired flavours - be it pandan, durian, salted egg, red bean or matcha-filled croissants and pastries.

Paris Baguette is responding to the demand through a halal-certified plant in Malaysia, to supply customers in South East Asia and the Middle East.

With the fascination around Korean culture globally, experts say there could be an opportunity for Asian bakeries to see even more success.

Korean and Japanese culture is so popular around the world now that maybe they're seeing things on their screen, and then they're willing to try it as well, said Saverio Busato, a pastry and bakery chef at the Culinary Institute of America in Singapore.

"I just came back from a trip to Italy and I was quite surprised to see a lot of Asian bakery and pastry shops in Italy and I was super happy.

To see the local people, the Italian people, that they were kind of exploring."

But can frozen dough produce the same quality of goods as an artisanal bakery?

I put Chef Busato to a blind taste test. He pulls apart a croissant made with frozen dough (although he doesn't know it), inspecting the elasticity and smelling it.

"This is quite bad. There is no honeycomb inside, it's totally hollow. The lamination doesn't have much strength because the internal part collapses. There is no butter profile. It's gluey and dense. There is no smell," he tells me.

Chef Busato acknowledges that it isn't practical to seek artisanal standards if you're mass-producing baked goods, and so big players will have to rely on frozen dough.

What about the traditional Asian baked goods though? Chef Busato on tasting a Korean milk bread, a fluffy white bread filled with cream, said he thinks it would do well in Europe.

"It's fantastic. It's very good. The smell of milk is coming over is nice. It's fluffy. It's refreshing... Reminds me of some kind of snack when I was younger that I was bringing to school."

- Adapting tastes

The cost-of-living crisis is a major challenge for Paris Baguette – not least because of the US inflation rate as it seeks to push into the American market. A lot of companies are having to change their business because it's not profitable for them, Mr Hur says.

One of Paris Baguette's biggest competitors globally – Pret A Manger – has had to experiment with subscription services and expand dine-in options after Covid pushed the sandwich and coffee chain into loss, and it was forced to close dozens of outlets and cut more than 3,000 jobs.

The global economic environment weighs on Mr Hur too but he insists profit is not his only goal. "If we are only trying to make profit, we'll just stay in Korea," he says.

"We want to change the bread culture around the world. I want to find a way to keep opening up a lot of bakeries. It is good for my country, and good for people."

### 翻譯
走進新加坡任何一個熱鬧購物中心的地下室，你很可能會聞到新鮮、奶油味十足的烘焙食品的香甜氣息。
長長的人龍擠滿了韓國、日本、台灣和新加坡的麵包店櫃檯——每個人手裡都拿著托盤和夾子，從擁擠的展示櫃中挑選奶油捲、牛奶麵包、夾餡可頌和水果酥點。
對於巴黎貝甜（Paris Baguette）來說，靈感顯然來自於品牌名稱，店面裝潢也採用法國三色旗的顏色，招牌上有艾菲爾鐵塔，整體氛圍似乎在追求巴黎咖啡館的魅力。
但它卻是百分之百的韓國品牌。
「我不會把我們的麵包只侷限於法國。我們是一個國際品牌。」巴黎貝甜母公司SPC集團的總裁兼執行長許鎮洙（Jin-soo Hur）說。
「像可頌這樣的產品，你能說它是歐洲的嗎？我會說它是全世界的產品。」
SPC的起源可以追溯到80年前一家家族經營的小麵包店。
如今，它已成為韓國大規模生產麵包和糕點的關鍵企業，在所有品牌下僱用了2萬名員工。SPC表示，去年銷售額達到56億美元（42.6億英鎊）。
1988年，巴黎貝甜誕生，成為第一個在中國開設國際分店的韓國麵包品牌，而中國至今仍是其重要市場。
如今，它在亞洲、歐洲和美國等14個國家擁有4000家門市。
巴黎貝甜有著龐大的海外擴張計畫，目標是在2030年前於國際間再開設超過1000家新分店——其中許多將在美國。
它正在德州投資建設一家工廠，預計2027年完工後，將成為其最大的海外生產基地，供應美國、加拿大和拉丁美洲。
對許鎮洙來說，打入美國市場是首要任務，因為這代表巴黎貝甜在國際上取得了成功。

- 食物即文化
體育是巴黎貝甜策略的核心之一，透過與英超足球俱樂部托特納姆熱刺（Tottenham Hotspur）的合作。
它曾與法國巴黎聖日耳曼（Paris St Germain）有過兩季的合作，在主場比賽日為球迷提供烘焙產品和甜點。
「我認為食物就是文化。體育能把很多人帶進體育場，倫敦總是充滿美好氛圍。」許鎮洙說。
韓國國家隊隊長同時也是熱刺隊長。孫興慜（Son Heung-min）上個月帶領球隊贏得歐洲聯賽冠軍，結束了球隊17年無冠的等待。
但對許鎮洙來說，重點不是韓國人帶領熱刺。
「熱刺是一家頂級球會，巴黎貝甜也想成為同類中的佼佼者。」他說。

- 韓流熱潮
「員工們不喜歡一大早起來手工揉麵糰。」許鎮洙輕聲說。
他認為公司將冷凍麵糰配送到全球加盟店的系統，提高了效率，也延長了保存期限。
亞洲有著豐富的烘焙傳統，但隨著城市化加速和生活型態改變，對即食便利食品的需求正穩步增長。
該地區的麵包店已經提供了各式各樣的商品。
像巧克力可頌和三明治這類主食很常見，但也以亞洲風味著稱——無論是班蘭、榴槤、鹹蛋、紅豆還是抹茶夾餡的可頌和糕點。
巴黎貝甜透過馬來西亞的清真認證工廠來回應這些需求，為東南亞和中東的顧客供貨。
隨著全球對韓國文化的著迷，專家認為亞洲麵包店有機會取得更大成功。
「韓國和日本文化現在在全球都很受歡迎，也許人們在螢幕上看到後就願意嘗試。」新加坡美國烹飪學院的糕點與烘焙主廚Saverio Busato說。
「我剛從義大利旅行回來，驚訝地發現那裡有很多亞洲麵包和糕點店，我非常開心。
看到當地人、義大利人也在探索這些。」
但冷凍麵糰能做出和手工烘焙一樣品質的產品嗎？
我讓Busato主廚進行盲測。他撕開一個用冷凍麵糰做的可頌（他並不知道），檢查彈性並聞味道。
「這個很糟糕。裡面沒有蜂巢結構，完全是空的。層次不夠強，內部塌陷。沒有奶油香氣。口感黏稠又密實。沒有香味。」他告訴我。
Busato主廚也承認，如果要大規模生產烘焙食品，追求手工標準並不實際，因此大企業只能依賴冷凍麵糰。
那傳統的亞洲烘焙食品呢？Busato主廚品嚐韓國牛奶麵包（一種夾奶油的蓬鬆白麵包）時表示，他認為這在歐洲會很受歡迎。
「太棒了，非常好。牛奶的香氣很明顯。口感蓬鬆、清新……讓我想起小時候帶去學校的點心。」

- 口味的調整
生活成本危機是巴黎貝甜面臨的重大挑戰——尤其是在美國通膨率高漲、公司試圖進軍美國市場時。許鎮洙說，許多公司不得不改變經營方式，因為已經無法獲利。
巴黎貝甜在全球最大的競爭對手之一——Pret A Manger——在疫情後因為虧損被迫關閉數十家分店、裁員超過3000人，之後不得不嘗試訂閱制和擴大內用選項。
全球經濟環境也讓許鎮洙感到壓力，但他堅持利潤不是唯一目標。「如果我們只想賺錢，就只會留在韓國。」他說。
「我們想改變世界各地的麵包文化。我想找到方法繼續開更多麵包店。這對我的國家好，對大家也好。」
