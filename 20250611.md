## 文章標題：Starbucks accelerates new staffing model to all North American stores- **連結**：https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/starbucks-accelerates-new-staffing-model-all-north-american-stores-2025-06-10/


June 10 (Reuters) - Starbucks (SBUX.O), opens new tab CEO Brian Niccol told Reuters on Tuesday that he would accelerate the rollout of the coffeehouse chain's new staffing and service model, aiming for all 18,000 North American stores by summer's end, rather than the initial plan for just a third of U.S. stores by year-end.

Niccol says the model is a foundational element of his turnaround strategy for the company, as he bets on an improved in-store customer experience to reclaim the sales growth that has eluded Starbucks in recent quarters.

Niccol said early tests of the model have sped up service times and grown sales, without providing specifics. “We’ve learned, and now we know what we need to do, so let’s scale it,” he told Reuters at the company's three-day leadership summit in Las Vegas on Tuesday.

The Green Apron model includes in-store technology to more efficiently sequence orders, as well as a dedicated barista for drive-through orders. Starbucks rolled out the service changes to 700 stores initially. During the company's April 29 quarterly earnings call, Niccol said it would be introduced in a third of U.S. stores by year-end.

Niccol took over as Starbucks CEO in September with a plan to return the chain to its coffeehouse roots, focusing on the in-store experience and away from a reliance on mobile and to-go orders, in what the company calls "Back to Starbucks.” The goal is to get baristas to get customers their orders in four minutes or less.

He did not share any financial figures about the cost of the Green Apron model's deployment, but said the company would host an investor day in 2026. The Las Vegas summit, the company's first since 2019, is hosting more than 14,000 managers and other company leaders.

Analysts and investors have wondered how long Niccol will need to turn the company around. Shares have gained 11% over the last five years, compared with an 88% rise in the broad-market S&P 500. TD Cowen recently downgraded its rating of Starbucks to "hold" from "buy", saying in part that it believed Niccol's turnaround would take longer than expected to deliver results.

Niccol said the transition will take time. Starbucks has not issued annual guidance, and Niccol told investors in an earnings call earlier this year that earnings-per-share “shouldn’t be used as a measure of our success” at this stage, instead pointing to in-store metrics like average wait times for orders. He said the transition's effect on earnings would be temporary.

On Tuesday, he emphasized his goal isn't to achieve short-term performance solely through cost reduction. As Starbucks increases investments in its labor and elsewhere, Niccol said he would be "ruthless" in cutting expenses not related to the company's turnaround. “We have to be critical of where we’re spending if it’s not driving toward the Back to Starbucks strategy and growth programs.”

6月10日（路透社）——星巴克（SBUX.O）首席執行官布萊恩·尼科爾週二告訴路透社，他將加速推出咖啡連鎖店的新的人員配置和服務模式，目標是在夏季結束前覆蓋所有18,000家北美門店，而不是最初計劃的僅在年底前覆蓋三分之一的美國門店。

尼科爾表示，這一模式是他公司轉型策略的基礎元素，因為他押注於改善店內顧客體驗，以重新獲得星巴克在最近幾個季度中未能實現的銷售增長。

尼科爾在公司於拉斯維加斯舉行的為期三天的領導峰會上告訴路透社，該模式的早期測試已經加快了服務時間並增加了銷售，但未提供具體數據。他說：“我們已經學到了，現在我們知道該怎麼做，所以讓我們擴大規模。”

綠圍裙模式包括店內技術以更有效地排序訂單，以及專門的咖啡師負責得來速訂單。星巴克最初在700家門店推出了這些服務變更。在公司4月29日的季度財報電話會議上，尼科爾表示，這一模式將在年底前引入三分之一的美國門店。

尼科爾於9月接任星巴克首席執行官，計劃將連鎖店重返其咖啡館根基，專注於店內體驗，遠離對移動和外帶訂單的依賴，這是公司所謂的“回到星巴克”。目標是讓咖啡師在四分鐘或更短時間內將訂單交給顧客。
他沒有分享綠圍裙模式部署的成本財務數據，但表示公司將在2026年舉辦投資者日。這次拉斯維加斯峰會是公司自2019年以來的首次，吸引了超過14,000名經理和其他公司領導者。

分析師和投資者一直在猜測尼科爾需要多長時間才能扭轉公司局面。過去五年，星巴克的股價上漲了11%，而大盤S&P 500上漲了88%。TD Cowen最近將星巴克的評級從“買入”下調至“持有”，部分原因是認為尼科爾的轉型需要比預期更長的時間才能見效。

尼科爾表示，轉型需要時間。星巴克尚未發布年度指引，尼科爾在今年早些時候的財報電話會議上告訴投資者，現階段不應將每股收益用作衡量成功的標準，而應關注店內指標，如訂單的平均等待時間。他表示，轉型對收益的影響將是暫時的。

週二，他強調他的目標不是僅通過削減成本來實現短期業績。隨著星巴克增加對勞動力和其他方面的投資，尼科爾表示，他將“無情”地削減與公司轉型無關的開支。“如果我們的支出不是朝著回到星巴克策略和增長計劃推進，我們就必須批判性地看待我們的支出。”
